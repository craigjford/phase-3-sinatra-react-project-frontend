# The Vineyard Application

## Overview
The project will enable users to keep a repository of vineyards and the wines available for each vineyard.  The frontend is written in React and is a sinple page application.  The frontend will display Vineyard information and their associated Wines information.  It will also interact with the background to send CRUD requests via Sinatra API.  The backend is written in Ruby and utilizes Sinatra and Ruby with active record.  The backend will called by the frontend to perform CRUD actions on both the Vineyards and its associated Wines.  The backend will utilize SQL Lite to persist the data and send back the necessay information in JSON format to allow the frontend to perform necssary actions.

## React Frontend

The frontend will initially display a Home page with a Navigation bar of Home and Vineyards upon invocation.  The frontend utilizes React's Router functionality to navigate throughout the single page application.  Following is a list of Components and how to navigate to each:

App
|_ NavBar
    |_Home
    |_Vineyards
        |_VineyardList
            |_VineyardForm
            |_Vineyard  
                |_WineForm
                |_WineDelete
                |_WineUpdate  

## React Component Functions

App - is the top-level component of the application.  It is called from index.js.  The component connects to the backend to get all the vineyards including their associated wines and sets it to State.  The component uses Routes to navigate to each component with the exception of Vineyard List.  It passes props to each component which includes callbacks.  The App also provides the final touches for every CRUD action to keep the Vineyards State in sync with the what backend has persisted to the database.  

NavBar - is called from App and is displayed on each page.  The navigation bar will have two options - Home and Vineyards.  Home will navigate to the home page and Vineyards will navigate to the vineyards page.  

Home - is routed from App.  The Home page contains a brief synopsis of what the purpose of the application. 

Vineyards - get passed all the vineyards and their associated wines.  The component maps through the vineyards and create separate Vineyards which are displayed on the Vineyard List component.

Vineyard List - is passed all vineyards and their associated wines for each individual component.  Each vineyard has the name and a image of the vineyard, a delete button, a link to add a vineyard and a link to the Vineyard details.  If a user clicks on the delete button, this component will call the backend to delete the vineyard and its associated wines and than utilize the callback prop to App to keep Vineyards state is sync with the database. If the user clicks on the add vineyard link, this component will use Link to proceed to the provided route which the App component directs application traffic.  In the same manner, if the user clicks Details link, this component will navigate throgh App's Route to the Vineyard component.

Vineyard - this component will display all the details relating to a vineyard which includes the name, image, address, city, state and its associated wines.  If no wines exist, it will display the a "No Wines Exist" header.  It is passed vineyards.  Components utilize useParams to get the vineyard to filter through vineyards.  It also contains a Add Wines, Delete Wines and Update Wines link which are again uses the App Routes to go to the appriopriate component.  The Add Wines link will route to the WineForm component.  The Delete Wines link will route to the WineDelete component.  The Update Wines link will route to the WineUpdate component.  The Add, Delete and Update will be passed the vineyards prop and the appropriate callback to vaigate to App to keep Vineyards and their associated state in sync.

VineyardForm - provides a form that contains input fields for a Vineyard which includes name, address, city, state and a Vineyard image.  Initially, an empty Vineyard object will initailize Vineyard State.  As fields are changed, fields in State will be changed.  All fields are required.  Upon inputting all the fields, user can click Submit button which will send an API to backend to POST a vineyard.  Upon successful completion, processing in passed to App to keep Vineyards State in sync and use Routing to pass processing back to VineyardForm.  

WineForm - is passed all the vineyards and their associated wines and a callback to update state as described in App.  Components utilize useParams to get the vineyard to filter through vineyards.  The component will display the Vineyard name and all the associated wines that have been added to the Vineyard.  It will display "No Wines Exist" if that is the case.  The component will use state containing an empty wine object that gets updated as input fields are filled.  The component will also have a form that contains input fields that enables the user to add a wine that includes year, name and price to add to the Vineyard.

WineDelete - is passed all the vineyards and their associated wines and a callback to update state as described in App.  Components utilize useParams to get the vineyard to filter through vineyards.  The component will display the Vineyard name and all the associated wines that have been added to the Vineyard.  It will display "No Wines Exist" if that is the case. For each wine there will be a radio button of which only one can be selected.  To Delete a wine, select a wine and click the Delete button.  Upon clicking on the Delete button, a DELETE API will be sent to the backend.  Upon successful completion, processing is passed back to App component via callback to keep State in sync.

WineUpdate - is passed all the vineyards and their associated wines and a callback to update state as described in App.  Components utilize useParams to get the vineyard to filter through vineyards.  The component will display the Vineyard name and all the associated wines that have been added to the Vineyard.  It will display "No Wines Exist" if that is the case. For each wine there will be a radio button of which only one can be selected.  The component will also have a form that contains input fields for year, name, price and an Update button.  When a wine is selected via the radio button, the input fields will be populated with the selected info.  The user change change the value of any or all of the fields.  This component also keeps an empty wine object in state that gets updated upon selection via clicking on a radio button.  It further gets updated via changes to any of the input fields.  Upon clicking the Update button, the component will send a UPDATE API to the backend and upon successful completion will process App to keep App's State in sync.     


##  Backend Using Sinatra and Ruby Activerecord

Using Ruby's Rake db:create_migration and db:migration, two tables were created, Vineyards and Wines.  The vineyards table contains name, address, city, state and imageUrl.  The wines table contains name, price, year and vineyard_id.  A vineyard has many wines and a wine belongs to a unique vineyard.  Hence, wine's vineyard_id is a foreign key to vineyards.  These associations are defined in the Vineyard.rb and Wine.rb models.  Vineyard.rd establishes that a Vineyard has many wines.  Vineyard.rd also uses the dependent destroy parameters that insures upon deleting a vineyard, all of its associated wines will also be deleted.  Wine.rb establishes that a wine belongs to a vineyard.

To accomodate all of the frontend's CRUD requests, the following actions are in the Vineyard controller and the Wine controller.  The Vineyard contoller handles the following routes.  The get request gets all the vineyards and their associated wines by utiliziing the include parameter.  Additionally, the request return the results JSON-ified back to the frontend.  There is a delete request which passes id as a paramenter and deletes the one Vineyard with the passed id.  The post route creates a new vineyard with the parameters passed.  It returns the resulting JSON back to the frontend.

The Wine controller has the following actions.  The post wines uses vineyard_id to add wines to the associated vineyard.  The delete route is passed a wine id to delete the appropriate wine.  The update route is also passed in a wine id to ensure the correct wine's name, price and year are appropriately updated.
